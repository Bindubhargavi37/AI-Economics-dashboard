🎯 Project Objective
The DA-AI (Data Analytics – Artificial Intelligence) Project sets out to determine which AI company possesses the strongest long-term revenue engine and the most defensible business model. It addresses the lack of a single, comparable financial view across both public and private AI giants.

Core Research Questions:

Revenue Velocity: How fast is each company's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) increasing? 


Monetization Strategy: What is the split between consumer subscriptions and enterprise contracts? 


Operational Efficiency: Which company earns money most efficiently (Gross Margin) and what is their cash burn rate? 


Product Power: Which AI model (GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5, Llama 4) is the most commercially powerful? 

🛠️ Dashboard Features
The interactive HTML dashboard is organized into five specialized views:


🏆 Executive Overview: A high-level scorecard showing the 2025 AI market size ($70B), fastest-growing players, and overall market share.


📈 Revenue Analysis: Detailed ARR trends from 2022–2025 and segmentation of revenue by customer type (Consumer vs. Enterprise vs. API).


💰 Profitability & Efficiency: Comparison of Gross Margins (e.g., Anthropic at 77%) and LTV:CAC ratios against the 3:1 industry benchmark.


🤖 AI Model Comparison: Performance-to-cost analysis of major models, including an overall winner highlight (Meta AI/Llama 4).


🚀 Future Growth: Projections for 2030 ARR across three scenarios: Bear, Base, and Bull cases.

📈 Key Findings (2025 Data)

Market Leader: OpenAI currently holds the largest user base with 800M Weekly Active Users.


Growth Champion: Anthropic leads in growth velocity with a 488% YoY revenue increase and a near-SaaS gross margin of 77%.


Infrastructure Spend: The industry-wide CapEx for AI infrastructure (2023–2025) reached a staggering $538B.


Long-term Outlook: The AI market is projected to reach $500B by 2030—a 7× growth from 2025 levels.
